# Tree Eraser
A Factorio mod that allows you to remove trees from the world. It removes entities defined as type 'tree'.

To use it, craft a Tree Eraser, found on the Production tab. It functions like a Blueprint or Deconstruction Planner. With the Tree Eraser in hand, click and drag a rectangle encompassing the trees you want to remove.

This is based on the idea of [Tree Eraser mod by No0Vad](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tree-eraser), and is a fork of the original Ore Eraser mod by Tergiver.
